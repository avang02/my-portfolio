                <p>
                    I was 6 when my parents got our first computer. The first thing my brothers and I did was to simply
                    play games. As life went on, it became an addiction that forced me to make necessary choices that I
                    never wanted to. Those choices lead me to work a variety of odd jobs, however it wasn't as bad as it
                    would seem since I develop many skills throughout those careers. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Leveraging my previous experience as a full-time head custodian, I bring a unique blend of 
                    leadership, adaptability, and problem-solving skills to every project. Proficient in a wide 
                    range of technologies including [list specific languages, frameworks, tools], I thrive in dynamic 
                    environments where I can apply my expertise to drive innovation and efficiency. Whether leading a 
                    team or tackling complex coding challenges, I am dedicated to delivering high-quality solutions 
                    that exceed expectations. My journey from custodian to software engineer has equipped me with a 
                    valuable perspective on teamwork, resourcefulness, and attention to detail, which I integrate 
                    seamlessly into my approach to software development. Let's connect and explore how we can 
                    collaborate to create impactful solutions together.

                <p>
                    One day I decided, I wanted to switch careers. The career of choice was picking back where I left
                    off in college; software development. Because computers are a bunch of simple instructions combined
                    to solve complex problems, I believe I am a simple man who just wants the simple things in life; love,
                    appreciation of beauty, and videogames to solve my own complex problems. I'm always hungry for knowledge
                    and when something peaks my curiosity, I do whatever it takes to learn and understand it.
